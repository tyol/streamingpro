StreamingPro is a fast, expressive, and convenient system running on Spark with streaming, batch, interactive query, and machine learning support.

StreamingPro makes it easier to build spark applications without writing any code by means of:

* Using json file in combination with modules, which are easy to be reused. This provides users declarative configurations to build spark applications.
* Data processing is based on SQL.
* Script support. 
 
StreamingPro is not only an out-of-box complete application, but also an extensible and programmable framework for spark since you can develop you ower compositors(a.k.a moduler). 

## Features

* Pure Spark Streaming (or normal Spark) program
* No need of coding, only declarative workflows
* Rest API for interactive querying
* SQL-Oriented workflows support
* Data continuously streamed in & processed in near real-time
* dynamically CURD of workflows at runtime via Rest API 
* Flexible workflows (input, output, parsers, etc)
